# A numerical approach to solving Schrödinger equation.

Python programs to solve numerically the Schrödinger equation for an arbitrary potential in both: one-dimensional case and the radial component of the wave-function for the three-dimensional case.

This programs are designed to be runned in Jupyter notebook to ease user's experience and facilitate working with arbitrary potentials. It allows the user to obtain the eigenvalues, eigenstates and an animation of the temporal evolution of the probability density of a particle in such potential. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION: The only block which has to be modified is the first one. Should you were to modify deeper code or other blocks, this may trigger malfunctions to the program.

PRECISION: The Richardson method used in calculating the eigenvalues, ensures a rapid, robust and accurate results. Furthermore, the program has been numerically stressed out with different high-dificulty potentials, such as the Poschl-Teller modified potential,

EXTRA: Furthermore, it is also presented a real-case application, which allows to study the radial wave-fucntion of the Hydrogen atom, through the three-dimensional case. The angular wave-function is also obtained thorugh the analytic expression and is represented in a polar plot and 3D to show the shape of electron orbitals in H atom, for an arbitrary value of the azimuthal quantum number l.
